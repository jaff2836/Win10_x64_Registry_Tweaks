# Windows_x64_Registry_Tweaks

This is my collection of registry tweaks for Windows 10/11 64bit.
You can manually add/remove comment to use or not use the tweaks.

This is currently wip, but you can currently add the registry.

All registry codes are in TenForums/ElevenForums, MajorGeeks, AskVG.com and Ray Woodcock.


# TODO

Add a .ps1 file to easily enable/disable the registry to be applied.
