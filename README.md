# Windows_x64_Registry_Tweaks

This is my collection of registry tweaks for Windows 10/11 64bit.
You can manually add/remove comment to use or not use the tweaks.

This is currently wip, but you can currently add the registry.

All registry codes are in TenForums/ElevenForums, MajorGeeks, AskVG.com and Ray Woodcock.



# Windows 11 Registry

I recently added Windows 11 Registry Tweaks. If the registry is not applied, the registry is applied but does not actually work, or there is an error in the registry application, please open an issue.



# TODO

Add a .ps1 file to easily enable/disable the registry to be applied.
